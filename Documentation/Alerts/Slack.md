   Open your preferred web browser and log in to your Slack workspace where you want to use the Prosole Slack App.

2. **App Directory:**
   Click on the "Apps" in the left sidebar to access the App Directory.

3. **Search for "Incoming Webhook":**
   In the App Directory search bar, type "Incoming Webhook" and press Enter.

4. **Add to Workspace:**
   Locate the "Incoming Webhook" app and click on it. You will be directed to the app's page. Click the "Add to Workspace" button to add it.

5. **Choose Channel:**
   Select the channel where you want to receive logs and alerts using the Prosole Slack App. This channel will be the destination for your logs and alerts.

6. **Authorize:**
   Grant the "Incoming Webhook" app the necessary permissions and authorize it to post messages to the selected channel.

7. **Webhook URL:**
   After authorizing, you will be provided with a "Webhook URL." This URL is used to send logs and alerts to the specified channel.
